## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: Used `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, I used TimeAgo react component to dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

<!-- ### What I learned

I learned about so many things about react
- React hooks and states
-  -->

### Continued development

I want to learn more about React itself and the how to use reusable components more effectively, and how to also use global/reusable functions across any components. The naming conventions of my components and classes of different elements also need some improvements.

I also want to learn more about fetching data from a server.

### Useful resources

- [React Time Ago](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-timeago) - This helped update the time, the comment was created or edited (How long ago it was created or edited)
